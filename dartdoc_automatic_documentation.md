# Dartdoc API reference for Flutter



## What is Dartdoc?

Dartdoc is an automatic documentation generation tool for Dart language. The ```dart doc``` command generates HTML documentation from Dart source code by looking for and parsing comments on your code that have a special syntax. You can also add descriptions to the generated documentation by using documentation comments, which can contain Markdown formatting.

## How to write dartdoc doc comments

The regular comment syntax for Dart code is ```//```. However, using ```///``` for your comments instead enables Dartdoc to find those comments and generate documentation for them.

This will be picked up by dartdoc:

```[âœ“]

/// The number of characters in this chunk when unsplit.
int get length => ...
```

This will not:

```[x]

// The number of characters in this chunk when unsplit.
int get length => ...
```


## How to generate documentation

To generate documentation for Flutter using dartdoc, first run these two commands from the root directory of a package:

```pub global activate dartdoc ``` or ```flutter pub get```
```dartdoc```

Then make sure your package analyzes without errors running:

```flutter analyze```
