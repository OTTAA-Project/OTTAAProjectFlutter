# Welcome to the OTTAA Project #

The [OTTAA Project](https://www.ottaaproject.com/) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) mobile application intended for users with speech and language impairments. It is a fast and effective tool that significantly improves users' quality of life and facilitates their social and labor reintegration. We have already positively impacted the lives of more than 40000 people in 11 countries, helping individuals with cerebral palsy, aphasia, autism, Down syndrome, and mild ALS.

You can be a part of this open-source project and help build life-changing technology, join us!

Read our [Project's Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OTTAA-Project/projects/4/views/1) to learn about what features we are currently working on, what stage they are in, and when we expect to deliver them to you.

## How does it work?

The OTTA app facilitates human communication via pictograms for those who are speech impaired, suggesting to each user the most appropriate pictograms based on preference, need, and environment. Watch this video for a more comprehensive walkthrough.

## Getting started: setting up your IDE for the first time

* Run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies.
* Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to generate the model class code.
* Run `flutter run` to run the project.
* run `flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000` to run the project in web.

\* In case you encounter any errors in model building:

* Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.

## Technology Standards

Open standards establish protocols and building blocks to help make digital public goods more functional and interoperable. This not only streamlines product development but also removes vendor-imposed boundaries to read or write data files by improving data exchange and open-source development support that is why we use the following Technology standards across our software and implementations.

* HTTPS for secure communication over networks
* OAuth 2 for authentication and user authorization
* UTF-8 for string localization and internalization
* JSON for database structure and data transfer
* PNG & Webp for images and pictograms
* OGG for audio files

## FAQ

We have compiled a list of FAQs, you can check it [here](place_holder: link to FAQs once posted in [web](https://ottaa-project.github.io/docs/welcome))
