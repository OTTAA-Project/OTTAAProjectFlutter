# Welcome to the OTTAA Project #

The [OTTAA Project](https://www.ottaaproject.com/) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) mobile application intended for users with speech and language impairments. It is a fast and effective tool that significantly improves users' quality of life and facilitates their social and labor reintegration. We have already positively impacted the lives of more than 40000 people in 11 countries, helping individuals with cerebral palsy, aphasia, autism, Down syndrome and mild ALS.

You can be a part of this open source project and help build life changing technology, join us!

Read our [Project's Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OTTAA-Project/projects/4/views/1) to learn about what features we are currently working on, what stage they are in, and when we expect to deliver them to you. 

## How does it work?

The OTTA app facilitates human communication via pictograms for those who are speech impaired, suggesting each user the most appropriate pictograms based on preference, need, and environment. Watch this video for a more comprehensive walk through.

## Getting started: setting up your IDE for the first time

* Run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies.
* Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to generate the model class code.
* Run `flutter run` to run the project.

\* In case you encounter any errors for model building:

* Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
