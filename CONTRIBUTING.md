### Get started: setting up your IDE

- Run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies.
- Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to generate the model class code.
- Run `flutter run` to run the project.
- If you encounter any errors for model building, run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.

### Reporting an issue

Provide as muc information as possible about the bug. Mention the version of OTTAA Project and explain how the problem can be reproduced.

### Code Contributions

#### Submitting a pull request
In order to create a pull request is necessary

#### Documentation

##### Comments
* Comment documenting the source code are required.

* Comment a class explaining the purpose of that and how to implements if that required.

##### Indentation


 Switch case
```
#!java
Align by  such as these cases :

Switch(value){
    case 0:
       // Todo action here
    break;
    Default:
       // Todo default action here
    break;
}
```
If / else or else if
```
#!java

if(value.toString().equals("Hello")){
  //To do action here
}else if{
  // To do action here
} else{
  // Todo
}

```
**Remember: **

* The attributes of the class must be protected or private

* The Method of the class must be public, private or protected

* The class must be public or private

### Naming ###
** Name:** That must be transparent and representative about the action to show us.

**Class:** should be nouns in UpperCamelCase, with the first letter of every word capitalized.
example :

```
#!java
public class Json(){

}
```
**variable:** 	Local variables, instance variables, and class variables are also written in lowerCamelCase.

example :

```
#!java

String name =" Carl";
String fileName="json.txt";
```

**Constant:** Constants should be written in uppercase characters separated by underscores.

example :


```
#!java

public static final String CONSTANT_NAME=" fileName.txt";
```

#### Firebase index:

This is the Three in firebase :

```
#!code

index
â”œâ”€â”€ Edad
â”œâ”€â”€ email
â”œâ”€â”€ Fotos
|    â”œâ”€â”€ nombre_foto
|    â””â”€â”€ url_foto
â”œâ”€â”€ FotosUsuario
â”œâ”€â”€ Frases

### Analytics Implementation

[Here](https://github.com/VicColombo/ottaa_project_flutter/blob/master/AnalyticsImplementation.md) is the list of events that should be tracked.

## As a translator

We currently support Spanish, English, Portuguese and French, but we are open to adding new languages as users' needs arise. Everyone is welcome to contribute with suggestions, changes or error corrections via email at **support@ottaaproject.com**, use subject "Contribution".

Our focus right now is growing in Latin America, with this in mind we would love some help with **pictogram localization**, that is to say, to have pictograms translated **based each country/region-specific culture and Spanish variety**. For example, we know that ðŸš— is commonly *carro* in MÃ©xico but *auto* or *coche* in Argentina. 

Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and the Caribbean are our current priorities, but of course we welcome help with any of our supported languages and regions.


## As a manual tester

We have test cases for manual testing [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khElUEbtREVsTzwxKmLYfdDYJxCnz0zcNaIraRYaMGs/edit) and we mainly need help testing the overall functionality of the new Flutter version.

Any bug or hotfix that results from manual testing should be reported via an [issue](https://github.com/OTTAA-Project/ottaa_project_flutter/issues) in our GitHub repository using the [template](https://github.com/OTTAA-Project/ottaa_project_flutter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) for bug reporting.


## As an automation tester 

We will be implementing a continuous integration workflow that will be running multiple automated testing. In the meantime, any experience with CI/CD and automated testing in Dart is very much welcome. Feel free to contact us at **support@ottaaproject.com**.
