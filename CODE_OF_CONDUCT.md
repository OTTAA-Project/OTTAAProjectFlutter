## OTTAA Project Open Source Code of Conduct

### Our core principles

**Diversity helps us  grow**  

We truly believe that diversity of experiences, backgrounds and knowledge contributes to building a better and more complete tool which more accurately reflects the real needs of potential users of the OTTAA Project. With that in mind we respect and welcome all differences in our users' and developers' age, gender, nationality, race or sexual orientation.

**Debate enriches us** 

In line with our first core principle we encourage developers, testers, contributors, users and other members of the OTTAA Project to speak up and bring their experience and ideas to the table while maintaining a respectful and friendly environment. That way, we can all work better and faster in improving the OTTAA Project, reaching consensus and resolving issues.

### Behavior in accordance with our principles

Bearing our core principles in mind, we ask everyone to comply with the following guidelines in our code of conduct in any and every interaction among the OTTAA community:
